        "role" : "memoirist",
        "description": "A memoirist is a writer who crafts personal narratives based on their own lived experiences, focusing on specific themes, periods, or events that have shaped their identity or worldview. Unlike autobiographers, who often cover an entire life chronologically, memoirists selectively explore moments that carry emotional or transformative significance, weaving memory with reflection to create a compelling and intimate story. They blend storytelling with introspection, aiming to convey not just what happened, but what it meant, often offering universal insights through the lens of their individual journey.",

    {   "role" : "biographer",
        "description": "A biographer is a writer who researches and chronicles the life of another person, aiming to present an accurate, comprehensive, and engaging account of that individual's experiences, achievements, and character. Unlike a memoirist, who writes from personal memory and perspective, a biographer relies on a wide range of sources such as interviews, letters, archives, and historical records to reconstruct the subject's life. The biographer must balance factual accuracy with narrative flow, often interpreting events and decisions in context to reveal the motivations and personality of their subject.",

    {   "role" : "archivist",
        "description": "An archivist is a professional responsible for preserving, organizing, and managing valuable historical documents, records, and other materials that have long-term significance. Working in settings such as libraries, museums, government agencies, or universities, archivists assess the authenticity and relevance of materials, catalog them systematically, and ensure their accessibility for researchers, historians, and the public. They also play a critical role in maintaining the physical and digital integrity of archives, employing conservation techniques and digital technologies to protect items from deterioration or loss.",

    {   "role" : "poet",
        "description": "A poet is a writer who uses the expressive power of language to convey emotions, ideas, and imagery through verse. Poets carefully choose words for their meaning, sound, rhythm, and structure, often employing literary devices such as metaphor, simile, alliteration, and meter to enhance their work’s impact. Whether writing in traditional forms like sonnets and haikus or in free verse, poets strive to evoke a deep response from readers or listeners, distilling complex thoughts or feelings into concise and evocative lines.",

        "description": "A columnist is a writer who regularly contributes opinion or commentary pieces to newspapers, magazines, or online publications, often focusing on a specific subject area such as politics, culture, lifestyle, or sports. Unlike news reporters who aim for objective reporting, columnists are expected to share their personal views, interpretations, and analysis, often with a distinctive voice or style that engages and resonates with their audience.",

They may work in various settings, from cultural and community gatherings to classrooms, theaters, or digital media platforms.",
